# Data Science yelp project
In this project,my friend Amit and I,studied the conecction between opening a new restaurant in the US, and getting a good review on Yelp website.
our research question is: "can we predict if a new restaurant in the US will get a good grade in YELP reviewing website given we know her amenities ?"
The project conducted using Python, Data Science and Machine Learning. The answer is no, you simply cannot predict getting a good review from a person no matter what amenities your business contains.
